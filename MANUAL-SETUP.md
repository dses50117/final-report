## Step 4: Create Repository
Click the **"Create repository"** button

## Step 5: Share with Email (If Private)
If you created a private repository and want to share it with someone:

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/final-report`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Click on **Collaborators** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Add people"**
5. Enter the email address or GitHub username

The person will receive an email invitation to access the repository.

## Step 6: Clone to Your Computer (Optional)
If you want to work on the repository locally:

```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
